Speed divider               [x]

Make new: 
Speed Divider 
Speed Multiploer 
Frequency shifter 2 notes up or down ´
Minimap einblendbar machen
Equalizer


TODO:
- write documentation for every node with screenshots. 
- add history to return to old saves. 
- EVentBus GUI handling needs fixxing GUI to Vortual is obviously broken make nodeid+GUI. usw. as alternative. 
- The clock is still buggy when changing stuff in edges. 

- Write a Grain sampler or Grain syntheziser. 

CONNECTIONS IS TOTALLY FUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEED TO CLEAN UP

Was ist kaputt? 

Bugs: 
- On new node i get multi Clock 
- Speed multiplier not working during playback
- third part sampler node not working
